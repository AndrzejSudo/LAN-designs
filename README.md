Network LAN topologies
==================

Several simulated network designs made in GNS3 VMware and Packet Tracer, utilizing Cisco devices and services.
All of them are aligned with Cisco Certified Network Associate level, as I was creating them as part of my journey towards CCNA certification.

Available networks:

- Campus 	- 4 configured VLANs with centralized DHCP server for PC endpoints. Inter-vlan routing done via SVIs on L3 switches, which are also set-up as DHCP relay agents. Configured ROAS interfaces on routers and DHCP for IP addresses assignment to specific subnets. Floating static routes for default gateway were also configured between routers and Internet PE router.
